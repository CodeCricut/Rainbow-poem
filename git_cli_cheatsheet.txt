Creating and cloning a remote repository:
1. Create a repository using Github
2. git init                                 - create a local repository
3. git add --all                            - add files from workspace
4. git commit -m "message"                  - commit the files to track
5. git remote add origin [url]              - add the remote repo that we want to push to
6. git push -u origin master                - push the tracked files onto the remote repo

Making changes:             
1. git add --all                            - add files from workspace
2. git commit -m "message"                  - commit the files to track
3. git remote add origin [url]              - add the remote repo that we want to push to
4. git push -u origin master                - push the tracked files onto the remote repo

Creating branches:          
1. git branch                               - list the current branches
2. git branch <feature-branch>              - create a new feature branch
3. git checkout <feature-branch>            - switch to the feature branch
    2 + 3. git checkout -b <feature-branch> - shorthand for steps 2 and 3
4. git commit -m "message"                  - changes will only apply to this branch
5. git push -u origin <feature-branch>      - apply the changes to the new branch

Merge Branches: 
1. git checkout master                      - Change to branch you want to merge with
2. git merge <feature-branch>               - merge your new branch into your active branch


NOTE: These steps will likely change later on. I am not sure if these commands are all correct.
