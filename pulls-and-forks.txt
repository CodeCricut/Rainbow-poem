Previously, we learned about branches. Branches allow us to isolate new features without
disrupting the sanctitiy of the master branch. Once we are satisfied with those changes, we 
can merge them to the master branch.

If a user wishes to create a copy of another user's repo, then you can fork it. You may 
have heard of cloning repositories before, but that is a GitHub specific term. Forking 
creates a carbon copy of the original repo, including the branch history.

Say you created a super cool branch to a repository you forked, and want to update the original
repo. You probably don't have permission to push the changes to the repo, but you can put out a 
pull request. A pull request means you are requesting that the original repo accepts the changes 
you made.
