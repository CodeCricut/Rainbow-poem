Github allows users to file issues. Remember, issues are not a part of Git; they are GitHub specific.

Submitting an issue is pretty straigtforward, so I won't cover it. 

Issues can only be resolved by the owner of the repo, or the person who filed the issue.

Each issue has a unique ID. You can reference this ID in your commit messages to automatically update
the related issue page. For example, if I use the commit message "Fixed spelling as per #10", the page
corresponding to the #10 issue will automatically link to the commit page.
